shall not remove or alter any copyright or other notices associated with the 
Software

RESTRICTIONS: The Software may be distributed only in connection the 
distribution of COMPANYï¿½s Products, and only subject to the following 
additional Restrictions:  (a) NSC Components:  The Software may be used 
only in connection with Components that are incorporated into COMPANY's 
Products; (b) Sublicensing Source:  The Software may be sublicensed in 
Source form, without any right to grant further downstream sublicenses, 
solely in accordance with this Agreement including these Restrictions;  
(c) Confidentiality.  The Source form of the Software is confidential,

product thereof, shall not be, directly or indirectly, exported, re-exported, 
or released to any destination without first obtaining any export license or 
other approval required by the U.S. government, or other applicable non-U.S. 
governments.  This provision shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

Any COMPANY Product incorporating any Software (or any FPGA or other hardware 
implementation) and associated Components should not be released to production 
without full test, verification, and qualification, including verification of 
the selection, configuration and performance of any Software (or any FPGA or 
other hardware implementation) and/or Components, and including verification 
that the product design meets functional, performance, reliability and any 
applicable export or other regulatory requirements.

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  NSC or its licensors shall not be liable for any 
direct or indirect or punitive damages of any kind, including but not limited 
to any special, consequential or incidental damages, including any costs of 
labor, delay, requalification, or replacement, and any lost business 
opportunity, profits, or goodwill, whether arising out of the use or 
inability to use the Software (or the use or inability to use any COMPANY 
Product incorporating the Software), even if NSC is advised of the 
possibility of such damages.  In no event shall NSC's aggregate liability from 
any obligation arising out of or in connection with the license or use of the 
Software, under any theory of liability including but not limited to contract,
